			 colorgcc version 1.3.2

Introduction
============

colorgcc is a perl wrapper that colorizes the output of the 
gcc/g++ compiler. 


Installing
==========

Make sure you have the ANSIColor.pm module, and a terminal that
groks color escape sequences. (The ANSIColor.pm module may be
found on www.cpan.org.)

In a directory that occurs in your PATH _before_ the directory
where the compiler lives, create a softlink to colorgcc for
each compiler you want to colorize:

    g++ -> colorgcc
    gcc -> colorgcc
    cc  -> colorgcc
    etc.

When "g++" is invoked, colorgcc is run instead.  colorgcc looks at the
program name to figure out which compiler to use. 

Copy the sample colorgccrc file to $HOME/.colorgccrc and make sure the
absolute paths for the compilers are correct for your system.
See the comments in the sample .colorgccrc for more information.


Note:

colorgcc will only emit color codes if:

   (1) Its STDOUT is a tty and
   (2) the value of $TERM is not listed in the "nocolor" option.

If colorgcc colorizes the output, the compiler's STDERR will be
combined with STDOUT. Otherwise, colorgcc just passes the output from
the compiler through without modification.


Gotchas
=======

   Packages that use autoconf ("configure") apparently determine
the default location of $prefix from the location of gcc. If you
create the softlinks as recommended above, $prefix will become
_that_ directory instead of what it should be (/usr/local, for
example). 

   It's easy to get around this by giving an explicit --prefix=/usr/local
when you configure a package, but it's a minor annoyance.
