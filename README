This is a fork of colorgcc which supports gcc, sun, ibm, hp and intel
compilers.
This version includes patches made by the gentoo developers to the original
colorgcc-1.3.2.
sun, ibm, hp and intel support added by Dmitry Goncharov.

# colorgcc
#
# Version: 1.3.2
#
# $Id: colorgcc,v 1.10 1999/04/29 17:15:52 jamoyers Exp $
#
# A wrapper to colorize the output from compilers whose messages
# match the "gcc" format.
#
# Requires the ANSIColor module from CPAN.
#
# Usage:
#
# In a directory that occurs in your PATH _before_ the directory
# where the compiler lives, create a softlink to colorgcc for
# each compiler you want to colorize:
#
#    g++ -> colorgcc
#    gcc -> colorgcc
#    cc  -> colorgcc
#    etc.
#
# That's it. When "g++" is invoked, colorgcc is run instead.
# colorgcc looks at the program name to figure out which compiler to run.
#
# The default settings can be overridden with ~/.colorgccrc.
# See the comments in the sample .colorgccrc for more information.
#
# Note:
#
# colorgcc will only emit color codes if:
#
#    (1) Its STDOUT is a tty and
#    (2) the value of $TERM is not listed in the "nocolor" option.
#
# If colorgcc colorizes the output, the compiler's STDERR will be
# combined with STDOUT. Otherwise, colorgcc just passes the output from
# the compiler through without modification.

#       exec compiler when not colorizing to preserve STDOUT, STDERR.
